Caching with GeoWebCache
========================

.. image:: geowebcache.png

GeoWebCache is a tiling server.  It runs as a proxy between a map client and map server, caching (storing) tiles as they are requested, eliminating redundant request processing and thus saving large amounts of processing time.  GeoWebCache has been integrated into GeoServer, although it is also available as a `standalone product <http://geowebcache.org>`_ for use with other map servers.

This section will discuss the version of GeoWebCache embedded in GeoServer.  For information about the standalone product, please see the `GeoWebCache homepage <http://geowebcache.org>`_.
